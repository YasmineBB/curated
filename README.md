# Curated

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Curated is a full stack e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django and uses Stripe as the payment processor.

This project was created for my fifth and final project for my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute.

## User Experience

### Strategy Plane

#### Project Goals

Curated is a Business to Consumer e-commerce site (B2C) and its target audience are people who want to browse and buy unique, one off art pieces by independent artists for their homes.

They will be people who enjoy and appreciate art, the work that goes into the pieces and the story behind them.

According to [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-drives-art-buyers), the top two reasons for buying unique art pieces were *“to decorate their homes and to provide a source of inspiration in their daily lives.”*

In interviews, *“collectors indicated that a work’s aesthetic appeal is frequently the gateway to a deeper exploration of the artist and their career.”*

Curated platforms the artists as well as the art, giving potential buyers the opportunity to explore and understand the artist and their work.

### Scope Plane

#### Feature Planning

I created the following table of opportunities for the project to determine the trade-off of importance versus viability of my user stories rated low (1) to high (5). Features that score highly on importance and viability are to be addressed first in achieving the MVP, followed by features who score in the mid and low range which can be added in future versions.

| **User Type** | **Feature** | **Importance** | **Viability** | **MVP** | **Delivered** |

#### Wireframes

Wireframes for this project were created in Balsamiq.

### Surface Plane

#### Colour Scheme

I have chosen to use an overall muted colour scheme with a bold blue feature colour. The reason for this is so that the artworks are the main focus for the user, and the site provides a clean base for the works. The name of the site is a bold blue, and most of the text on the site is in black, to contrast against the white background. When an item in the navigation bar is hovered over, it's highlighted in a golden yellow colour to make it clear to users the page they will be selecting.

Below is the colour scheme which was created in [Coolers](https://coolors.co/000000-2a5ddf-d39822-ffffff).

#### Font

I used [Font Joy](https://fontjoy.com/) to generate font pairings so that I could see the font choices together and if they worked well. I sourced the fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/selection).

## Agile Development

I used agile development to help me plan and manage my time more effectively. This was the second time applying it, my previous fourth project being the first, and I feel as though I utilised it in a much more effective way.

I used GitHub projects to build the board. I created issues for the user stories and each issue was given a Milestone and Labels to help.

This is my projects board around the start of my project.

I had 7 Epics, and split the user stories across these epics.

I used the MoSCoW method for prioritisation, using the following labels:

- must-have
- should-have
- could-have
- wont-have
- future-implementation

The project was divided into four sprints, each sprint having a two-week timeframe. These sprints were under the Milestones heading.

## SEO and Web Marketing

## Web Marketing

I created a mock-up of a Facebook business page from the template provided by Code Institute, as well as a mock-up of an Instagram business page.

## Features

### Current Features

#### Navigation

The navigation bar includes a search bar where users can search for terms that are included in the product name, category, description as well as the artist name.

Also included is a profile link where users can log in and out, and a shopping bag icon that displays the contents if the user has added any items.

Below that are navigation links to the products, categories and artists.

Under Products, the user can select to sort by:

- Price
- Category
- Artist

Or they can select to view All Products.

Under the Ceramics and Paintings options, the user can select to view all from those two categories.

Under the Artists option, the user can select to view all artists.

#### Homepage

#### Products Page

The products page displays all the pieces that are available to purchase. They are listed with the following:

- Product image
- Name
- Category tag (e.g. ceramics or paintings)
- Artists name
- Price
- Product description

#### Product Detail Page

Once a product is selected, the user is taken to the product detail page which lists all the same information, as well as the option of adding the item to the basket.

#### Shopping Basket Page

#### Checkout Page

#### Artists Page

The Artist's page displays a selection of all the artists who have their work listed on the site. The artist is represented by their photo and name, and when hovered over, the user can see a preview of the artists' bio with a link to read more.

#### Artist Detail Page

When a user selects an artist, they are taken to the artist detail page which gives the full set of information, including the artists social media links, if they have them.

The links to socials only take the user to each sites homepage for the purpose of this project, but if this site was developed in the future, of course this would be accurate.
