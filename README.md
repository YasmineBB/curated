# Curated

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Curated is a full stack e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django and uses Stripe as the payment processor.

This project was created for my fifth and final project for my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute.

## User Experience

### Strategy Plane

#### Project Goals

Curated is a Business to Consumer e-commerce site (B2C) and its target audience are people who want to browse and buy unique, one off art pieces by independent artists for their homes.

They will be people who enjoy and appreciate art, the work that goes into the pieces and the story behind them.

According to [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-drives-art-buyers), the top two reasons for buying unique art pieces were *“to decorate their homes and to provide a source of inspiration in their daily lives.”*

In interviews, *“collectors indicated that a work’s aesthetic appeal is frequently the gateway to a deeper exploration of the artist and their career.”*

Curated platforms the artists as well as the art, giving potential buyers the opportunity to explore and understand the artist and their work.

### Scope Plane

#### Feature Planning

I created the following table of opportunities for the project to determine the trade-off of importance versus viability of my user stories rated low (1) to high (5). Features that score highly on importance and viability are to be addressed first in achieving the MVP, followed by features who score in the mid and low range which can be added in future versions.

Wireframes for this project were created in Balsamiq.

### Surface Plane

#### Colour Scheme

I have chosen to use an overall muted colour scheme with a bold blue feature colour. The reason for this is so that the artworks are the main focus for the user, and the site provides a clean base for the works.
